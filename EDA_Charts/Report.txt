The goal of this project was to predict wine quality using physicochemical features of wine samples. The task followed a structured machine learning workflow — from data cleaning to API deployment  with an emphasis on interpretability and business relevance.

Data Preparation & Cleaning

Dataset: Red wine quality dataset containing numerical  variables such as 'acidity', 'sulphates', 'alcohol', etc.

Cleaning steps:
Removed duplicate records, there are 937 duplicates in the data so i have to remove them so that we will be able to get good prediction.
Handled missing values with isna().sum() but fortunately there are no missing values in the data

Verified correct data types, tried to check the datatypes which was numerical 'float' and 'integer' 
Detected and visualized outliers (using boxplots).
Scaled all numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure uniform model input.

Target Mapping
The target variable quality (ranging from 3 to 9) was categorized into qualitative labels for interpretability:
Best: 8–9
Good: 6–7
Average: 5
Bad: 3–4
This mapping makes predictions more meaningful to wine producers and stakeholders.

Modeling Approach
Base Model: Logistic Regression — provided a baseline accuracy for comparison.
Advanced Models:
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
After evaluation on test data using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix, the Random Forest Classifier emerged as the best-performing model.

Model Performance
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy and balanced F1-score across all classes.
It performs particularly well for “Good” and “Best” wines, meaning it can reliably identify wines of higher commercial value.
Precision and Recall tradeoffs indicate that the model avoids excessive false positives (incorrectly labeling poor wines as good) — crucial for maintaining brand quality.

Feature Importance
Wines with higher alcohol, sulphate, and citric acid levels tend to be rated higher in quality, while excessive volatile acidity or density reduces perceived quality.
